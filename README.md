# rocket-maths

A mental maths web application built in React that helps kids improve thier mental maths abilty

**Phase 1:**
- Calculator like app that takes you through differnet levels of mental math difficulty

**Phase 2:**
- An interactive codeAcademy like web application for math that takes you through a series of stories based math simulations that you can solve



**Quiz State**

The state(only truth) of the quiz, stored in the App component
{
	question: [] -> An array of questions generated by logic
	operator: -> Operator used in the question
	answer:
	answerDisplay:
	correctAnswers:
	level:
}

**Components:**

App
- Logic
- DisplayQuestion
- DisplayAnswer
- Keypad


App:
The parent component that holds the state Quiz.
- Calls the TestLogic function based on inputs recived from keypad

DisplayQuestion:
- Takes the state {question} as props and displays the question

DisplayAnswer:
- Takes the state {displayAnswer} as props and displays the answer 

Keypad:
- Takes the state { } as props 
- Listens for onClick and returns the keyValue back to App 


Logic:
- Recives the entire current state as an object
- Check if Answer is correct
- Update Level
- Build a question & Update a question
- Set up the Answer 


**Features to be added:**
1. Type your answer from anywhere on the screen
2. Show a progress bar ( answer 10 correct to move to next level)
3. Create differnet levels and difficulty
4. Achivement page to display your achivements
5. An animation for sucessfully completing a level

**Design Roadmap**

Left container ( story + input )
1. Naviagte to different levels
2. Input component

Right Contiainer ( output)
1. Output container with graphic elements



**Future Roadmap:**

1. Self learning LMS CodeAcademy/freeCodeCamp style
2. Math Simulation based learning games like
-  Bulid a lemonade stand
-  Running an apple store
